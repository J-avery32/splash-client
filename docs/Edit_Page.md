## Metadata
In the upper right corner you can see a card that will display the date created and the creator. If the document has been edited then it will also display the date it was last edited at and the name of the person who edited it.

## View past versions
This button will take you to the ["Versioned view"](#) of this page.

## The Document
There will be a box that displays the actual content of the document. To edit the document, double click anywhere inside the box, or click on the pen icon in the upper left corner of the document. Hovering over any parenthetical references in the document should display a small pop up next to the cursor that will contain the APA citation of the corresponding reference. Clicking on any in-text citations will bring you down to 
    
 ## Editing the document
 * ### Editor toolbar:
    The use of each button will be displayed by a tooltip if the the user hovers their mouse over the icon.
 * ### Insert Reference:
    This button will open up the "Insert Reference" pop up. Which is explained later in this document.
* ### Save/Cancel:
    The "Save" button will be disabled unless some change has been made to the document. The "Cancel" button will discard all changes made to the document since the last edit. 

## Inserting in-text citations
This dialog box is used for inserting parenthetical citations into the text. It will insert these citations at where your cursor was located when you clicked the "Insert Reference" button. 

You currently have two options. One, you can search the splash database itself for any references that may have been saved to it by other users. Secondly you can copy paste the DOI of the wanted reference into the "Create a Reference" field. This field will search a third party database for this specific reference. When you click "Create New," it will display the reference info with a "Create" button, that will save this reference to the splash database and insert it into the document. If this reference already exists in the splash database, you will be notified, it will display the citation and display an "Insert" button that will insert the citation into the document. Finally, if the DOI cannot be found in the third party database then the dialog box will inform you of that.

## Saving with conflicts
Sometimes while you are editing a document, another user may also edit the document and then save their changes before you do. In this case, when you save your changes a dialog will pop up notifying you of this and it will display a button that says "View their changes." Clicking on this button will open a pop up window that displays the most updated version of the document. If you go back to the editing page, you will now see a button underneath the title that says "View changes" which will bring you to the pop up window. After merging the changes and clicking the "Save" button. A dialog will pop up asking: "Are sure you have succesfully merged the two documents?" Clicking "No" will bring you back to your editing screen. Clicking "Yes" will save your changed to the document.

## Citations 
This table is meant to display every citation that is referenced in the document. It displays the APA citation format. It essentially acts as a bibliography. The only way that these citations can be added or removed is by editing the corresponding in-text citations.

## Additional References
This table is meant to display other references, not directly cited in the text but that may be relevant to the document. These can be removed and added at will, unlike the "Citations" table. The x button in the left of all the reference rows will remove that reference from the table. The button at the bottom "Add Additional Reference" will open up a dialog that is identical to the one described the "Inserting References" section.
